## What's new on Adobe Developer Console

### Migrate to the new OAuth Server-to-Server credential

The Service Account (JWT) credentials have been deprecated in favor of the OAuth Server-to-Server credentials. Your applications using the Service Account (JWT) credentials will stop working after Jan 27, 2025. You must migrate to the new credential by **Jan 27, 2025**, to ensure your application continues functioning. [Learn more](./authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/migration.md)


### Email alerts

Adobe will send you [email alerts](email-alerts/index.md) whenever there is a potential or ongoing impact on your application. You can [add developers](email-alerts/index.md#managing-email-alert-recipients-in-an-enterprise-organization) in your organization as email alert recipients. You can also [pause email alerts](email-alerts/index.md#managing-noisy-email-alerts) for any projects that are not critical.

### Project Filters

Use Project Filters to narrow your search when looking for a specific project. You can filter by who created or last modified the project, any title or description used in the project, or any programmatic identifiers such as client id, technical accounts, namespaces, etc. You can also quickly view the projects that contain certificates expiring within the next 30 days.

### Project Activity Logs

View who created or last modified a project by visiting the Project overview page. You can also view the exact set of changes made to the project in the last year (who, what, and when) by visiting the [Activity Logs](projects/index.md#view-a-projects-activity-log) tab within the Project.
