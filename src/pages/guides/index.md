[App Builder template](guides/projects/projects-template.md)

Quickly start building an App Builder application by using the App Builder project template. App Builder provides all required developer tooling to build a Single Page App with Adobe's UI toolkit or microservices that orchestrate Adobe and non-Adobe APIs and services. [Learn more](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/).

[Plugins](guides/plugins/index.md)

Plugins enhance the functionality of Adobe products. End users of the plugins can install them through the marketplace and use them through the product UI. As a developer, you can add a plugin to your project and start building it. 


## What's new on Adobe Developer Console

### Migrate to the new OAuth Server-to-Server credential

TODO

Use secure and industry-standard OAuth2.0 credentials in your applications when integrating with Adobe APIs and services. Read more about our new credentials - [OAuth Server-to-Server](#TODO), [OAuth Web App](#TODO), [OAuth Single-Page App](#TODO), and [OAuth Native App](#TODO). 

### Email alerts

Adobe will send you [email alerts](email-alerts/index.md) whenever there is a potential or ongoing impact on your application. You can [add developers](email-alerts/index.md#managing-email-alert-recipients-in-an-enterprise-organization) in your organization as email alert recipients. You can also [pause email alerts](email-alerts/index.md#managing-noisy-email-alerts) for any projects that are not critical.

### Project Filters

You can now use Project Filters to narrow your search when looking for a specific project. You can filter by who created or last modified the project, any title or description used in the project, or any programmatic identifiers such as client id, technical accounts, namespaces, etc. You can also quickly view the projects that contain certificates expiring within the next 30 days.

### Project Activity Logs

You can now view who created or last modified a project by visiting the Project overview page. You can also view the exact set of changes made to the project in the last year (who, what, and when) by visiting the [Activity Logs](projects/index.md#view-a-projects-activity-log) tab within the Project.
