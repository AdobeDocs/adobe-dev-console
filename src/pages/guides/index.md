# Welcome to Adobe Developer Console

Adobe Developer Console allows you and your team to flexibly and easily connect to Adobe services, enable I/O Runtime, and manage your projects with new insights. Here are some of the exciting updates to Adobe Developer Console:

## Introducing developer orgs and unified public profile
    
All Adobe ID accounts now have access to advanced developer features, such as building service-to-service integrations, journaling for event subscriptions, and access to I/O Runtime (license permitting).

## A new era of Photoshop extensibility 
    
Adobe is making the Photoshop host app APIs more modern and introducing UXP, our new cross-app API platform. Add a Photoshop plugin to your project, download the starter template, then return to the Developer Console when you’re ready to distribute it.

## Add beta users

Select and manage a group of beta users who will have access to your integration while it’s still in development.

## Next steps

Now that you're familiar with the new features in Adobe Developer Console, read the [getting started guide](getting-started.md) to begin creating your own projects and building your own apps and plugins.
