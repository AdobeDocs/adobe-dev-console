All Adobe ID accounts now have access to advanced developer features, such as building service-to-service integrations, journaling for event subscriptions, and access to I/O Runtime (license permitting).

### A new era of Photoshop extensibility 
    
Adobe is making the Photoshop host app APIs more modern and introducing UXP, our new cross-app API platform. Add a Photoshop plugin to your project, download the starter template, then return to the Developer Console when you’re ready to distribute it.
