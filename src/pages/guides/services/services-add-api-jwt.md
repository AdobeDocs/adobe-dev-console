<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

Service Account (JWT) credentials have been deprecated in favor of the OAuth Server-to-Server credentials. View our [migration guide](../authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/migration) to know more. The new version of this guide that uses OAuth Server-to-Server credentials is now available here - [**Add API to project using OAuth Server-to-Server credentials**](../services/services-add-api-oauth-s2s).
